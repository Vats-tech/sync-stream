### Sync-stream ensure seamless API interactions, even in the absence of an internet connection.
The application allows users to make API calls as usual, and if the internet is unavailable, it intelligently buffers the requests. Once the connection is restored, Sync Stream automatically sends the buffered requests, ensuring no data or action is lost during offline periods.
